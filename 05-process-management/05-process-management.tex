    \slidetitle{Linux Terminology Is Slightly Different}

    You can look at a process' state by reading \texttt{/proc/<PID>/status | grep State}

    \leftspace{}Replace \texttt{<PID>} with the process ID (or \texttt{self})
    \bigskip

    R: Running and runnable [Running and Waiting]

    S: Interruptible sleep [Blocked]

    D: Uninterruptible sleep [Blocked]

    T: Stopped

    Z: Zombie
    \bigskip

    The kernel lets you explicitly stop a process to prevent it from running

    \leftspace{}You or another process must explicitly continue it

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}
    \slidetitle{On Unix, the Kernel Launches A Single User Process}

    After the kernel initializes, it creates a single process
    from a program
    \bigskip


    This process is called \texttt{init}, and it looks for it in \texttt{/sbin/init}

    \leftspace{}Responsible for executing every other process on the machine

    \leftspace{}Must always be active, if it exits the kernel thinks you're shutting down
    \bigskip

    For Linux, \texttt{init} will probably be \texttt{systemd} but there's other options
    \bigskip

    Aside: some operating systems create an ``idle'' process that the
    scheduler can run
  \end{slide}

    \slidetitle{A Typical Process Tree on the Virtual Machine}

    \begin{tikzpicture}[sibling distance=12em]
      \tikzstyle{every node}=[ellipse, draw, font=\scriptsize\ttfamily, align=center]
      \node {1: init}
        child { node {187: journald} }
        child { node {536: systemd --user}
          child { node [xshift=-6em] {597: gnome-shell}
            child { node { 946: firefox }
              child { node [xshift=12em] {996: firefox} }
              child { node [xshift=9em] {1089: firefox} }
              child { node [xshift=6.35em] {1147: firefox} }
            }
          }
          child { node {1071: gnome-terminal-server}
            child { node [xshift=9em] {1086: zsh}
              child { node {1240: htop}
              }
            }
          }
        }
        child { node {200: udevd} };
    \end{tikzpicture}

  \end{slide}

    \slidetitle{How You Can See Your Process Tree}

    Use \texttt{htop}
    \bigskip

    You can press \texttt{F5} to switch between tree and list view

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{Processes Are Assigned a Process ID (pid) On Creation and Does
                Not Change}

    The process ID is just a number, and is unique for every \textbf{active}
    process
    \bigskip

    On most Linux systems the maximum pid 32768, and 0 is reserved (invalid)
    \bigskip

    Eventually the kernel will recycle a pid, after the process dies, for a new process
    \bigskip

    Remember: each process has its own \textit{address space} (independent view of memory)

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{Maintaining the Parent/Child Relationship}

    Previously, we made sure that our parent exited last (by using \texttt{sleep})
    \bigskip

    What happens if the parent process exits first, and no longer exists?

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{The Parent Process is Responsible for Its Child}

    The operating system sets the exit status when a process terminates

    (the process terminates by calling \texttt{exit})

    \leftspace{}It can't remove its PCB yet
    \bigskip

    The minimum acknowledgment the parent has to do is read the child's exit status
    \bigskip

    There's two situations:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The child exits first (zombie process)
      \item The parent exits first (orphan process)
    \end{enumerate}

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{You Need to Call \texttt{\bfseries wait} on Child Processes}

    \texttt{wait} as the following API:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{status}: Address to store the wait status of the process
      \item Returns the process ID of child process

            \leftspace{}-1: on failure

            \leftspace{}0: for non blocking calls with no child changes

            \leftspace{}>0: the child with a change
    \end{itemize}
    \bigskip

    The wait status contains a bunch of information, including the exit code

    \leftspace{}Use \texttt{man wait} to find all the macros to query wait status

    \leftspace{}\leftspace{}You can use \texttt{waitpid} to wait on a specific child process

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{
      \texttt{\bfseries wait-example.c} Blocks Until The Child Process Exits,
      and Cleans Up
    }

    \begin{minted}{c}
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  pid_t pid = fork();
  if (pid == -1) { return errno; }
  if (pid == 0) {
    sleep(2);
  }
  else {
    printf("Calling wait\n");
    int wstatus;
    pid_t wait_pid = wait(&wstatus);
    if (WIFEXITED(wstatus)) {
      printf("Wait returned for an exited process! pid: %d, status: %d\n",
             wait_pid, WEXITSTATUS(wstatus));
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
    \end{minted}

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{A Zombie Process Waits for Its Parent to Read Its Exit Status}

    The process is terminated, but it hasn't been acknowledged
    \medskip

    A process may have an error in it, where it never reads the child's exit status
    \medskip

    The operating system can interrupt the parent process to acknowledge the child

    \leftspace{}It is just a suggestion and the parent is free to ignore it

    \leftspace{}\leftspace{}This is a basic form of IPC called a signal
    \bigskip

    The operating system has to keep a zombie process until it's acknowledged

    \leftspace{}If the parent ignores it, the zombie process needs to wait to
    be re-parented
  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{An Orphan Process Needs a New Parent}

    The child process lost its parent process

    \leftspace{}The child still needs a process to acknowledge its exit
    \medskip

    The operating system re-parents the child process to \texttt{init}

    \leftspace{}The \texttt{init} process is now responsible to acknowledge the
                 child
  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{
      \texttt{\bfseries orphan-example.c} The Parent Exits Before the Child,
      \texttt{init} Cleans Up
    }

    \begin{minted}{c}
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  pid_t pid = fork();
  if (pid == -1) {
    int err = errno;
    perror("fork failed");
    return err;
  }
  if (pid == 0) {
    printf("Child parent pid: %d\n", getppid());
    sleep(2);
    printf("Child parent pid (after sleep): %d\n", getppid());
  }
  else {
    sleep(1);
  }
  return 0;
}

    \end{minted}

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{
      \texttt{\bfseries zombie-example.c} The Parent Monitors the Child To Check
      Its State
    }

    \begin{minted}{c}
  pid_t pid = fork();
  // Error checking
  if (pid == 0) {
    sleep(2);
  }
  else {
    // Parent process
    int ret;
    sleep(1);
    printf("Child process state: ");
    ret = print_state(pid);
    if (ret < 0) { return errno; }
    sleep(2);
    printf("Child process state: ");
    ret = print_state(pid);
    if (ret < 0) { return errno; }
  }
    \end{minted}

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{You're Responsible for Managing Processes}

    The operating system maintains a strict parent/child relationship
    \medskip
    
    You should be able to identify (and prevent) the following:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Zombie processes
      \item Orphan processes
    \end{itemize}
