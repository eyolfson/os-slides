    \slidetitle{Sockets are Another Form of IPC}

    We've seen pipes and signals

    \leftspace{}We also talked about shared memory
    \medskip

    Previous IPC assume that the processes are on the same physical
    machine
    \bigskip

    Sockets enable IPC between physical machines, typically over the network

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}
    
    \slidetitle{Servers Follow 4 Steps to Use Sockets}

    These are all system calls, and have the usual C wrappers:

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \texttt{socket}

        \leftspace{}Create the socket
      \item \texttt{bind}

        \leftspace{}Attach the socket to some location (a file, IP:port, etc.)
      \item \texttt{listen}

        \leftspace{}Indicate you're accepting connections, and set the queue limit
      \item \texttt{accept}

        \leftspace{}Return the next incoming connection for you to handle
    \end{enumerate}

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}
    
    \slidetitle{Clients Follow 2 Steps to Use Sockets}

    Clients have a much easier time, they use one socket per connection

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \texttt{socket}

        \leftspace{}Create the socket
      \item \texttt{connect}

        \leftspace{}Connect to some location, the socket can now send/receive
                     data
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}
    
    \slidetitle{The \texttt{socket} System Call Sets the Protocol and Type of Socket}

    \mintinline{c}{int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);}
    \medskip

    \texttt{domain} is the general protocol, further specified with \texttt{protocol} (mostly unused)

    \leftspace{}\texttt{AF\_UNIX} is for local communication (on the same physical machine)

    \leftspace{}\texttt{AF\_INET} is for IPv4 protocol using your network interface

    \leftspace{}\texttt{AF\_INET6} is for IPv6 protocol using your network interface
    \medskip

    \texttt{type} is (usually) one of two options: stream or datagram sockets

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}
    
    \slidetitle{Stream Sockets Use TCP}

    All data sent by a client appears in the same order on the server
    \medskip

    Forms a persistent connection between client and server
    \medskip

    Reliable, but may be slow

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}
    
    \slidetitle{Datagram Sockets Use UDP}

    Sends messages between the client and server
    \medskip

    No persistent connection between client and server
    \medskip

    Fast but messages may be reordered, or dropped
  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}
    
    \slidetitle{The \texttt{bind} System Call Sets a Socket to an Address}

    \begin{minted}{c}
int bind(int socket, const struct sockaddr *address,
         socklen_t address_len);
    \end{minted}
    \medskip

    \texttt{socket} is the file descriptor returned from the \texttt{socket}
    system call
    \bigskip

    There's different \mintinline{c}{sockaddr} structures for different protocols

    \leftspace{}\mintinline{c}{struct sockaddr_un} for local communcation (just a path)

    \leftspace{}\mintinline{c}{struct sockaddr_in} for IPv4, a IPv4 address
                 (e.g. 8.8.8.8)

    \leftspace{}\mintinline{c}{struct sockaddr_in6} for IPv6, a IPv6 address
                 (e.g. \mintinline{c}{2001:4860:4860::8888})

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}
    
    \slidetitle{The \texttt{listen} System Call Sets Queue Limits for Incoming
                Connections}

    \mintinline{c}{int listen(int socket, int backlog);}
    \medskip

    \texttt{socket} is still the file descriptor returned from the
    \texttt{socket} system call
    \medskip

    \texttt{backlog} is the limit of the outstanding (not accepted) connections

    \leftspace{}The kernel manages this queue, and if full will not allow new connections
    \medskip

    We'll set this to \mintinline{c}{0} to use the default kernel queue size
  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}
    
    \slidetitle{The \texttt{accept} System Call Blocks Until There's a Connection}

    \begin{minted}{c}
int accept(int socket, struct sockaddr *restrict address,
           socklen_t *restrict address_len);
    \end{minted}
    \medskip

    \texttt{socket} is \textit{still} the file descriptor returned from the
    \texttt{socket} system call
    \medskip

    \texttt{address} and \texttt{address\_len} are locations to write the
    connecting address

    \leftspace{}Acts as an optional return value, set both to \texttt{NULL} to
                 ignore
    \medskip

    This returns a new file descriptor, we can \texttt{read} or \texttt{write}
    to as usual

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}
    
    \slidetitle{The \texttt{connect} System Call Allows a Client to Connect to
                an Address}

    \begin{minted}{c}
int connect(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr,
            socklen_t addrlen);
    \end{minted}
    \medskip

    \texttt{sockfd} is the file descriptor returned by the \texttt{socket}
    system call

    \leftspace{}The client would need to be using the same protocol and type
    as the server
    \medskip

    \texttt{addr} and \texttt{addrlen} is the address to connect to, exactly
    like \texttt{bind}
    \medskip

    If this call succeeds then \texttt{sockfd} is may be used as a normal
    file descriptor

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}
    
    \slidetitle{Our Example Server Sends ``Hello there!'' to Every Client and
                Disconnects}

    Please see \texttt{lectures/19-sockets} in your \texttt{materials}
    repository

    \leftspace{}Relevant source files: \texttt{client.c} and \texttt{server.c}
    \medskip

    We use a local socket just for demonstration, but you could use IPv4 or IPv6

    \leftspace{}We use \texttt{example.sock} in the current directory as our
                 socket address
    \medskip

    Our server uses signals to clean up and terminate from our infinite
    \texttt{accept} loop

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}
    
    \slidetitle{Instead of \texttt{read}/\texttt{write} There's Also
                \texttt{send}/\texttt{recv} System Calls}

    These system calls are basically the same thing, except they have
    \texttt{flags}
    \medskip

    Some examples are:

    \leftspace{}\texttt{MSG\_OOB} --- Send/receive out-of-band data

    \leftspace{}\texttt{MSG\_PEEK} --- Look at data without reading
    
    \leftspace{}\texttt{MSG\_DONTROUTE} --- Send data without routing packets
    \medskip

    Except for maybe \texttt{MSG\_PEEK}, you do not need to know these
    \medskip

    \texttt{sendto}/\texttt{recvfrom} take an additional address

    \leftspace{}The kernel ignores the address for stream sockets (there's a
                 connection)

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}
    
    \slidetitle{You Perform Networking Through Sockets}

    Sockets are IPC across physical machines, the basics are:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Sockets require an address (e.g. local and IPv4/IPv6)
      \item There are two types of sockets: stream and datagram
      \item Servers need to bind to an address, listen, and accept connections
      \item Clients need to connect to an address
    \end{itemize}
