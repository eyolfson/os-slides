    \slidetitle{How Should We Implement Virtual Mapping?}

    What are your ideas for mapping a process's virtual memory to physical
    memory?

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{Virtual Memory Checklist}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item [$\square$] Multiple processes must be able to co-exist
      \item [$\square$] Processes are not aware they are sharing physical memory
      \item [$\square$] Processes cannot access each others data (unless allowed explicitly)
      \item [$\square$] Performance close to using physical memory
      \item [$\square$] Limit the amount of fragmentation (wasted memory)
    \end{itemize}

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}
    
    \slidetitle{Remember That Memory is Byte Addressable}

    The smallest unit you can use to address memory is one byte
    \medskip

    You can read or write one byte at a time at minimum
    \medskip

    Each ``addresss'' is like an index of an array

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{Segmentation or Segments are Coarse Grained}

    Divide the virtual address space into segments for: code, data, stack, and heap

    \leftspace{}Note: this looks like an ELF file, large sections of memory with permissions
    \medskip

    Each segment is a variable size, and can be dynamically resized

    \leftspace{}This is an old legacy technique that's no longer used
    \medskip

    Segments can be large and very costly to relocate

    \leftspace{}It also leads to fragmentation (gaps of unused memory)
    \medskip

    No longer used in modern operating systems

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{Segmentation Details}

    Each segment contains a: base, limit, and permissions

    \leftspace{}You get a physical address by using: \texttt{segment selector:offset}
    \medskip

    The MMU checks that your offset is within the limit (size)

    \leftspace{}If it is, it calculates base + offset, and does permission checks

    \leftspace{}\leftspace{}Otherwise, it's a segmentation fault
    \medskip

    For example 0x1:0xFF with segment 0x1 base = 0x2000, limit = 0x1FF

    \leftspace{}Translates to 0x20FF
    \medskip

    Note: Linux sets every base to 0, and limit to the maximum amount

  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{Memory Management Unit (MMU)}

    Maps virtual address to physical address

    \leftspace{}Also checks permissions
    \medskip

    One technique is to divide memory up into fixed-size pages (typically 4096 bytes)

    \leftspace{}A page in virtual memory is called a page

    \leftspace{}A page in physical memory is called a frame

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{You Typically Do Not Use All 64 Virtual Address Bits}

    CPUs may have different levels of virtual addresses you can use

    \leftspace{}Implementation ideas are the same
    \medskip

    We'll assume a 39 bit virtual address space used by RISC-V and other
    architectures

    \leftspace{}Allows for 512 GiB of addressable memory (called Sv39)
    \medskip

    Implemented with a page table indexed by Virtual Page Number (VPN)

    \leftspace{}Looks up the Physical Page Number (PPN)

    \slidetitle{The Page Table Translates Virtual to Physical Addresses}

    \slidetitle{The Page Table Entry (PTE) Also Stores Flags in the Lower Bits}

    \slidetitle{The Kernel Handles Translating Virtual Addresses}

    Considering the following page table:
    \begin{center}
    {\ttfamily
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
      VPN  & PPN  \\
      0x0 & 0x1 \\
      0x1 & 0x4 \\
      0x2 & 0x3 \\
      0x3 & 0x7 \\
    \end{tabular}}
    \end{center}
    \medskip

    We would get the following virtual $\rightarrow$ physical address translations:
    \begin{center}
    \texttt{0x0AB0} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{0x1AB0}

    \texttt{0x1FA0} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{0x4FA0}

    \texttt{0x2884} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{0x3884}

    \texttt{0x32D0} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{0x72D0}
    \end{center}

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{Page Translation Example Problem}

    Assume you have a 8-bit virtual address, 10-bit physical address

    \leftspace{}and each page is 64 bytes
    \medskip

    \begin{itemize}
      \item How many virtual pages are there? \onslide<2->{$\mathsf{\frac{2^8}{2^6} = 4}$}
      \item How many physical pages are there? \onslide<2->{$\mathsf{\frac{2^{10}}{2^6} = 16}$}
      \item How many entries are in the page table? \onslide<2->{$\mathsf{4}$}
      \item Given the page table is \texttt{{[0x2, 0x5, 0x1, 0x8]}}

            \hspace{2em} what's the physical address of \texttt{0xF1}?

            \onslide<2->{\texttt{0x231}}
    \end{itemize}

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{Each Process Gets Its Own Page Table}

    When you \texttt{fork} a process, it will copy the page table from the parent

    \leftspace{}Turn off the write permission so the kernel can implement
    copy-on-write
    \medskip

    The problem is there are $\mathsf{2^{27}}$ entries in the page table, each
    one is 8 bytes

    \leftspace{}This means the page table would be 1 GiB
    \medskip

    Note that RISC-V translates a 39-bit virtual to a 56-bit physical address

    \leftspace{}It has 10 bits to spare in the PTE and could expand

    \leftspace{}Page size is 4096 bytes (size of offset field)

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{You May Be Thinking That Seems Like A Lot of Work}

    In the ``Subprocess'' lecture, we're doing a \texttt{fork} followed by
    \texttt{exec}

    \leftspace{}why do we need to copy the page tables?
    \medskip

    We don't! There's a system call for that --- \texttt{vfork}
    \medskip

    \texttt{vfork} shares all memory with the parent

    \leftspace{}It's undefined behavior to modify anything
    \medskip

    Only used in very performance sensitive programs

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{We Use Pages for Memory Translation}

    Divide memory into blocks, so we only have to translate once per block
    \medskip

    Use page tables (array of PTEs) to access the PPN (and flags)
    \medskip

    New problem: these page tables are always huge!
