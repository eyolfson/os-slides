  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{IPC is Transferring Bytes Between Two or More Processes}

    Reading and writing files is a form of IPC
    \medskip

    The read and write system calls allow any bytes

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{A Simple Process Could Write Everything It Reads}

    See: \texttt{06-basic-ipc/read-write-example.c}
    \medskip

    We \texttt{read} from standard in, and \texttt{write} to standard out

    \leftspace{}Does this remind you of any program you've seen before?
    \medskip

    If we run it in our terminal without arguments, it'll wait for input

    \leftspace{}Press Ctrl+D when you're done to send end-of-file (EOF)
  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}
    \slidetitle{\texttt{\bfseries read} Just Reads Data from a File Descriptor}

    See: \texttt{man 2 read}
    \medskip

    There's no EOF character, \texttt{read} just returns 0 bytes read

    \leftspace{}The kernel returns 0 on a closed file descriptor
    \medskip

    We need to check for errors!

    \leftspace{}Save \texttt{errno} if you're using another function that may
                  set it

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{\texttt{\bfseries write} Just Writes Data to a File Descriptor}

    See: \texttt{man 2 write}
    \medskip

    It returns the number of bytes written, you can't assume it's always
    successful

    \leftspace{}Save \texttt{errno} if you're using another function that may
                  set it
    \medskip

    Both ends of the read and write have a corresponding write and read

    \leftspace{}This makes two communication channels with command line programs

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{The Standard File Descriptors Are Powerful}

    We could close standard input (freeing file descriptor 0) and open a file
    instead

    \leftspace{}Linux uses the lowest available file descriptor for new ones
    \medskip

    See: \texttt{lecture-06/open-example.c} and \texttt{man 2 open}
    \medskip

    Without changing the core code, it now works with multiple input types

    \leftspace{}You could type, or use a file

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{Your Shell Will Let You Redirect Standard File Descriptors}

    Instead of running \texttt{./open-example open-example.c} we could run:

    \leftspace{}\texttt{./open-example < open-example.c}
    \medskip

    Your shell will do the \texttt{open} for you and replace the standard input

    \leftspace{}We didn't actually have to write that!
    \medskip

    You could also redirect across multiple processes

    \leftspace{}\texttt{cat open-example.c | ./open-example} 

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{Signals are a Form of IPC that Interrupts}

    You could also press Ctrl+C to stop \texttt{./open-example}

    \leftspace{}This interrupts your programs execution and exits early
    \medskip

    Kernel sends a number to your program indicating the type of signal

    \leftspace{}Kernel default handlers either ignore the signal or terminate
    your process
    \medskip

    Ctrl+C sends \texttt{SIGINT} (interrupt from keyboard)
    \medskip

    If the default handler occurs the exit code will be 128 + signal number

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{You Can Set Your Own Signal Handlers with \texttt{sigaction}}

    See: \texttt{06-basic-ipc/signal-example.c} and \texttt{man 2 sigaction}
    \medskip

    You just declare a function that doesn't return a value, and has an \texttt{int} argument

    \leftspace{}The integer is the signal number
    \medskip

    Some numbers are non-standard, below are a few from Linux x86-64:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item 2: \texttt{SIGINT} (interrupt from keyboard)
      \item 9: \texttt{SIGKILL} (terminate immediately)
      \item 11: \texttt{SIGSEGV} (memory access violation)
      \item 15: \texttt{SIGTERM} (terminate)
    \end{itemize}

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}
    \slidetitle{A Signal Pauses Your Process and Runs the Signal Handler}

    Your process can be interrupted at any point in execution

    \leftspace{}Your process resumes after the signal handler finishes
    \medskip

    This is an example of concurrency, your process switches execution

    \leftspace{}You have to be careful what you write here
    \medskip

    Run \texttt{./signal-example} and press Ctrl+C

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{You Need to Account for Interrupted System Calls}

    You should see:

    \leftspace{}\texttt{Ignoring signal 2}

    \leftspace{}\texttt{read: Interrupted system call}
    \medskip

    We can rewrite it to retry interrupted system calls

    \leftspace{}See: \texttt{06-basic-ipc/signal-example-2.c}
    \medskip

    Now the program continues when we press Ctrl+C

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{You Can Send Signals to Processes with Their PID}

    You can use the command: \texttt{kill}

    \leftspace{}It is also a system call, taking a \texttt{pid} and signal number
    \medskip

    Find a processes' ID with \texttt{pidof}, e.g. \texttt{pidof ./signal-example-2}
    \medskip

    After use \texttt{kill <pid>}, which by default sends \texttt{SIGTERM}
    \medskip

    Use \texttt{kill -9 <pid>} to tell the kernel to terminate the process

    \leftspace{}Process won't terminate if it's in uninterruptible sleep

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{Most Operations Are Non-Blocking}

    A non-blocking call returns immediately, and you check if something occurs
    \medskip

    To turn \texttt{wait} into a non-blocking call, use \texttt{waitpid} with
    \texttt{WNOHANG} in \texttt{options}
    \medskip

    To react to changes to a non-blocking call, we can either use a
    \textit{poll} or \textit{interrupt}

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{Polling Continuously Calls the Function and Checks for Changes}

    See: \texttt{06-basic-ipc/wait-poll-example.c}
    \medskip

    We call \texttt{waitpid} over and over until the child exits

    \leftspace{}Note: some hardware behaves like this,

    \leftspace{}\leftspace{}the kernel may have to check for changes
    \bigskip

    What's the drawback of this approach?

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{An Interrupt Instead Occurs Right After the Change}

    See: \texttt{06-basic-ipc/wait-interrupt-example.c}
    \medskip

    Instead of calling \texttt{wait} or \texttt{waitpid} from \texttt{main},
    we can do it in the interrupt handler

    \leftspace{}The kernel sends the \texttt{SIGCHLD} whenever one of its
                  children exit
    \medskip

    This idea also applies to the kernel, hardware can generate interrupts

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{Interrupt Handlers Run to Completion}

    See: \texttt{06-basic-ipc/signal-close-example.c}
    \medskip

    An interrupt may occur while an interrupt handler is already running
    \bigskip

    All interrupt handler code must be reentrant

    \leftspace{}You need to be able to pause execution,

    \leftspace{}execute another call (to the same function),

    \leftspace{}and resume execution

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{On a RISC-V CPU, There's 3 Terms for ``Interrupts''}

    \textit{Interrupt}

    \leftspace{}Triggered by external hardware,

    \leftspace{}handled by the kernel (needs to respond quickly)
    \bigskip

    \textit{Exception}

    \leftspace{}Triggered by an instruction (divide by zero, illegal memory
                  access),

    \leftspace{}default handler is the kernel (calling process suspended),

    \leftspace{}the process can optionally handle some of these themselves
    \bigskip

    \textit{Trap}

    \leftspace{}Transfer of control to a trap handler caused by either

    \leftspace{}an exception or an interrupt (code that runs)
    \medskip

    A system call would be a \textit{requested trap}
  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{We Explored Basic IPC in an Operating System}

    Some basic IPC includes:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{read} and \texttt{write} through file descriptors (could be a regular file)
      \item Redirecting file descriptors for communcation
      \item Signals
    \end{itemize}
    \medskip

    Signals are like interrupts for user processes

    \leftspace{}The kernel has to handle all 3 kinds of ``interrupts''
