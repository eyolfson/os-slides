    \slidetitle{A Process Control Block (PCB) Contains All Information}

    Specifically, in Linux, this is the \texttt{\color{blue}
    task\_struct} you can browse on

    \href{https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/linux/sched.h\#L743}
         {GitHub}
    \medskip

    It contains:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Process state
      \item CPU registers
      \item Scheduling information
      \item Memory management information
      \item I/O status information
      \item Any other type of accounting information
    \end{itemize}
    \medskip

    Each process gets a unique process ID (pid) to keep track of it

    \slidetitle{You Can Read Process State Using the ``proc''
                Filesystem}

    There's a standard \texttt{/proc} directory (on Linux) that represents the kernel's
    state

    \leftspace{}These aren't real files, they just look like it!
    \medskip

    Every directory that's a number (process ID) in \texttt{/proc} represents a
    process
    \medskip

    There's a file called \texttt{status} that contains the state
    (used for Lab 1)

    \slidetitle{We Could Create Processes from Scratch}

    We load the program into memory and create the process control block

    \leftspace{}(this is what Windows does)
    \bigskip

    Unix decomposes process creation into more flexible abstractions
  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}
    
    \slidetitle{Instead of Creating a New Process, We Could Clone It}

    Pause the currently running process, and copy it's PCB into a new one

    \leftspace{}This will reuse all of the information from the process,
    including variables!
    \medskip


    Distinguish between the two processes with a parent and child relationship

    \leftspace{}They could both execute different parts of the program together
    \bigskip

    We could then allow either process to load a new program and setup a new PCB

  \end{slide}

  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{
      \texttt{\bfseries fork} Creates a New Process, A Copy of the Current One
    }

    \mintinline{c}{int fork(void)} as the following API:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Returns the process ID of the newly created child process

            \leftspace{}-1: on failure

            \leftspace{}0: in the child process

            \leftspace{}>0: in the parent process
    \end{itemize}
    \medskip

    There are now 2 processes running

    \leftspace{}Note: they can access the same variables, but they're separate

    \leftspace{}\leftspace{}Operating system does ``copy on write'' to maximize sharing

    \slidetitle{
      On POSIX Systems, You Can Find Documentation Using \texttt{\bfseries man}
    }

    We'll be using the following APIs:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{fork}
      \item \texttt{execve}
      \item \texttt{wait} (next lecture)
    \end{itemize}
    \medskip

    You can use \texttt{man <function>} to look up documentation,

    or \texttt{man <number> <function>}

    \leftspace{}2: System calls

    \leftspace{}3: Library calls

      \texttt{\bfseries fork-example.c} Has One Process Execute Each Branch
    }

    \begin{minted}{c}

  pid_t returned_pid = fork();
  if (retured_pid == -1) {
    int err = errno;
    perror("fork failed");

  \begin{slide}

    \slidetitle{
      \texttt{\bfseries execve} Replaces the Process with Another Program, and
      Resets
    }

    \texttt{execve} has the following API:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{pathname}: Full path of the program to load
      \item \texttt{argv}: Array of strings (array of characters), terminated by
             a null pointer

            \leftspace{}Represents arguments to the process
      \item \texttt{envp}: Same as \texttt{argv}

            \leftspace{}Represents the environment of the process
      \item Returns an error on failure, does not return if successful
    \end{itemize}

    \slidetitle{
      \texttt{\bfseries execve-example.c} Turns the Process into
      \texttt{\bfseries ls}

  return 0;
}

  \begin{slide}
    \slidetitle{The Operating System Creates Processes}

    The operating system has to:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Maintain process control blocks, including state
      \item Create new processes
      \item Load a program, and re-initialize a process with context
    \end{itemize}
